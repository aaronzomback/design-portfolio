<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

      For creators, the film industry can seem daunting. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, independent filmmakers are encouraged to become self-reliant on distribution. <br> <br>

      I got the idea of creating a new platform called TimeSink that would help filmmakers connect with audiences by improving the experience of film festivals and art-house cinemas into an online network. <br> <br>

      As we see in art museums, art-house cinemas, and other galleries, the space that the work is experienced strongly influences how it is perceived. TimeSink will help focus audience expectations away from the quick bites of entertainment that we see on massive sites like YouTube, and shine a valuable spotlight on the films and its creators.

<li>Most film festivals aren't able to provide the value that filmmakers expect: large audiences, distribution deals, & industry connections.</li> <br>
<li>Many filmmakers are becoming disillusioned with the lack of transparency from festivals.</li> <br>
<li>i.e. Festivals often charge submission fees without providing proof of viewing submitted films.</li> <br>
<li>Some filmmakes think that there is simply too much content these days, which makes it difficult to stand out.</li> <br>

    <p>When the film was first released, it wasn’t a huge hit. It found its audience on the midnight movie circuit. Do you think a movie like Eraserhead could find an audience today?</p>
    <p class="lynch">No. The midnight movie circuit was what saved or brought a lot of films to the public...Ben Barenholtz, they call him “the grandfather of the midnight film” — if it wasn’t for Ben, I don’t think Eraserhead would have been discovered at all.</p>

  <h2>Transforming the arthouse <br> experience</h2>

  <p class="caption">AFA is an arthouse theater in New York City, founded by Jonas Mekas in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>While living in New York City, I was abe to experience the arthouse theater, Anthology Film Archives. Often it would show retrospectives, but sometimes it would spotlight work by current filmmakers. Such a place is able to promote an encouraging atmosphere for the art form; free of any box office expectations. What if there was a way to improve this theater-going experience by transforming it into an online network featuring more current filmmakers and making it easier to socialize. Transforming this experience into an online network would create a more accessible and interactive film culture. Perhaps its presence could inspire a new generation of filmmakers.</p>

 TimeSink will create a better platform for filmmakers by focusing on cinema tradition, artistic vision, honesty, respect, and curation rather than popularity.
 <br> <br> It's not in competition with massive video sharing sites like Youtube, Vimeo, TikTok, and Instagram. The appeal is not towards the mega-studio superhero film, but a niche audience of both creators and arthouse theater-goers. <br> <br> It will out-compete most film festivals by improving the film submission process, the presentation, and the audience participation. <br> <br>
