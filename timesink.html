<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="prologue-paragraph">
        <p> For creators, the film industry is a lot like the wild west. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, filmmakers are encouraged to become rugged individualists and weary self-promoters. <br> <br>

            One of the great directors of cinema, Stanley Kubrick, mentioned once in an interview that when he was a young filmmaker in New York City, the large cinemas would play local independent films after the feature presentations. </p> <br> <h4> This kind of support and exposure could have encouraged an entire generation of filmmakers. </h4> <br>

            <p>It seems such exciting and life-changing opportunities are rare in the 21st century where cinema screens are monopolized by mega-studio superhero flicks and rehashed sequels. So where are the filmmakers getting their opportunities these days? And I'm not talking about the big-name already established ones, but the emerging ones - just as all the masters of cinema once were. </p>

  <h5 style="text-align:left">MOVIES IN THE 2020'S</h5>
  <div class="current-platforms-paragraph">
      <p> "Broadcast yourself" was YouTube's first company slogan. Now, over a decade later YouTube has become the largest video platform in history. People enjoy more access than ever to present themselves and their work - all that's required is a simple video upload.<br> <br>

                In a world with rapid information sharing and an insatiable appetite for consuming quick and entertaining bits, short form video content has become king. <br> <br>With the rise of TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube shorts, the emphasis is now placed on the user-creators who are able to generate hundreds of thousands of views and therefore advertising revenue for their host companies. <br> <br> The problem with this type of system is that it tends to reward only certain types of deliveries. How many filmmakers are being lost because their films are not favorable to the algorithms?<br> <br>

        "We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO," said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. For companies like Netflix, winning people's time and attention is now more important than anything, including winning content. <br> <br> <b> Do filmmakers compete with this short form content? I don't think they have to nor should they try. </b><br> <br>

      <h5 style="text-align:left">FINDING the <br>PROBLEMS</h5>
  </div>

  <div class="research-text">


<p>To better understand the problems that filmmakers face, I chose to research online forums such as reddit, nofilmschool, and indiewire, on discussions between anonymous filmmakers and film enthusiasts. I thought that this type of a 'fly-on-the-wall' method would be more efficient in diagnosing current filmmakers’ pain points as opposed to conducting personal interviews and surveys.</p>

<p class="consensus-emerge">I began to notice a consensus emerging - festivals represent a huge market for filmmakers and especially the local economies that host them. But there only seems to be a few that filmmakers trust. In fact many filmmakers are frequently disappointed by the lack of value and support that film festivals generate towards developing their careers.<br> <br>

<b>As media becomes more fragmented and film festivals still representing a large market for filmmakers, I ask the question: it possible to improve the UX of film festivals by transforming it into a year-round experience?</b>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">A NEW RENAISSANCE</h5>
    <p>
     The cultural demand for artful films is still there, as evidenced by the recent success of production company A24 Films and many highly rated TV shows such as Euphoria, West World, Atlanta, Black Mirror, just to name a few. <br> <br> As we see in art museums and galleries, the environment and context that the works are experienced in plays a significant role to how the work is perceived. Creating a dedicated space for independent films, instead of a mega commercial highway like YouTube, will help focus audience expectations and shine a valuable spotlight on both the films and its creators.<br> <br>  <b> This is where I think TimeSink can become successful. By leveraging the flaws in the current film festival model, this type of a film platform is not in competition with TikTok, Netflix, or YouTube, but instead its mission will be to develop honesty, transparency, and respect in a niche marketplace to support the present and future generations of filmmakers.</b></p>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">FINDING OUR NICHE</h5>
    <p>I believe that competing with current film festivals will be possible if the platform gains the filmmakers' trust. But, if we want to differentiate TimeSink from apps such as YouTube, Netflix, or Vimeo, then it’s not enough to design for filmmakers and viewers. Instead, the design must be crafted towards a specific persona and idea. </p>
       <p>At this stage I identified TimeSink’s niche user; namely those who appreciate the art and history of cinema. By doing this, we not only begin to articulate the types of films that TimeSink would curate, as those who appreciate history often have developed taste, but also the brand personality, design principles, and overall theme. <br> <br>
         Already, this is different than a massive online hosted video platform like YouTube. <b> It is about becoming more specialized and I think by doing so, it raises the possibility of creating a super-loyal user base. </b> </p>

      To catalyze the process of creation and discovery, TimeSink must be able to attract both viewers and filmmakers into the same network (the TimeSink!). <b> With TimeSink, the platform is simultaneously the distribution and the audience. To make these connections possible, we must design a service that provides value - and I believe that the strongest shared value is growth. </b><br> <br>

      To the filmmaker value is growth in audience, ideas, collaborators, recognition, and investors. To the viewer, value is growing a connection to a healthy community and a sense of participation in the creative act. It is growth in discovering new films, connecting with other minds, having great discussions, and making new friends.<br> <br>

     In order to create a robust community, it is necessary to create one that is accessible at all times. It can’t be limited like a festival typically is to only a couple of days per year. So what features can help achieve all of the above?
