<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

        For many filmmakers promoting their film and trying to find audiences can be difficult and overwhelming.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="prologue-paragraph">
        <p> For creators, the film industry can seem daunting. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, independent filmmakers are encouraged to become self-reliant on distribution which often results in creating rugged individualism and tireless self-promotion.<br> <br>
        As media becomes easier to produce and consume, it paradoxically becomes more difficult for audiences to find and appreciate independent film because there's just so much content out there. <br> <br> I got the idea of creating a new platform called TimeSink that would help filmmakers connect with audiences by transforming the experience of art-house cinemas into an online network.<br> <br>

<section class="problem">
  <div class="problem-text">
    <h5 style="text-align:left">CONTEXT IS KEY</h5>
    <p>
     As we see in art museums, art-house cinemas, and other galleries, the environment and context that art is experienced in plays a significant role in how the artwork is perceived. Creating a dedicated space for films to redirect filmmakers away from a highly saturated site like YouTube, will help focus audience expectations and shine a valuable spotlight on both the films and its creators.<br> <br> Instead of more opportunities for self-monetization or self-distribution, filmmakers need more support and a healthy atmosphere where their work can flourish. This way they don't have to be casted on the same level as cheap entertainment.  <br> <br>This is where I think TimeSink can become successful. By leveraging the flaws in the current film festival model, this type of a film platform is not in competition with TikTok, Netflix, or YouTube, but instead its mission will be to develop honesty, transparency, and respect in a niche marketplace to support the present and future generations of filmmakers.</p>
