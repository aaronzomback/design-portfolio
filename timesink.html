    <p>If I were to claim that my design process was sparkling clean I'd be full of dust. In fact it's a clashing of ideas: reverse movement, forward movement, a circling back. I guess they call it iteration. Anyways, TimeSink is an on-going personal project of mine. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

    <p>As a filmmaker I consider the film industry to be like the wild west. There is no direct pathway towards growing an audience, securing distribution, or attracting investments. This is especially true for those who have little to no connections. <br> <br>

  We can try for our own distribution and upload films to YouTube or Vimeo but I've considered those platforms to be a far from ideal home for filmmakers; being oversaturated and too generalized. With few exceptions, most films hosted on such platforms will simply get lost among the noise of endless content. Film festivals can be helpful, but their influences may be fleeting. Couldn't there be something else that offers a more impactful and sustained culture for contemporary and independent film? <br> <br>

  I believe that there needs to be a centralized catalyst in the film industry that not only helps emerging filmmakers break through the noise and get the support they need to continue their art form, but also a curated film community where people can expect to discuss, meet, and discover. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center">Research</h2>
    <p>Before thinking about a design for a new film platform, I first wanted to conduct research in order to validate problems shared by many filmmakers. <br> <br>

Instead of interviewing other filmmakers, I chose to investigate online forums - like reddit and nofilmschool.com - for discussion between anonymous filmmakers. I thought that this type of a sales safari method would be more efficient in diagnosing current filmmakers’ pain points as opposed to conducting personal interviews.</p>

<p class="consensus-emerge">I began to notice a consensus emerging - filmmakers’ were disappointed that film festivals provided little value and support towards developing their careers.</p>
<p>I discovered that most filmmakers submit to and attend film festivals in order to find collaborators, gain representation, secure distribution, or attract investments.</p>

  <div class="process-research">

      There doesn’t seem to be a trusted and viable place for emerging independent film talent to establish their work. Aside from a handful of larger film festivals, many filmmakers no longer trust nor consider them to be relevant, especially with personal representation and distribution options available such as YouTube and Vimeo. This distrust appears to be caused by a lack of engagement and a lack of value generated towards their careers. Additionally, festivals often charge submission fees without providing proof of viewership. </p>
      <p class="impersonal"><b>These impersonal experiences cause filmmakers to feel marginalized, disillusioned, and discouraged.</b></p>

<section class="design-for">
  <div class="design-for-text">
    <h4 style="text-align:center">Who are we designing for?</h4>
    <p>To best inform the overall product design - from how it looks and feels, to how it works, I first had to identify exactly who this platform will be designed for.
       <p><b>It’s not enough to design for filmmakers and viewers - if we want to differentiate TimeSink from platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo, the design must be crafted towards a specific persona and idea.</b> </p>
       <p>At this stage I identified TimeSink’s niche user; namely those who appreciate the art and history of cinema. By doing this, we not only begin to articulate the types of films that TimeSink would curate (those who appreciate history often have developed taste) but also the brand personality, design principles, and overall theme. Already, this is different than a massive online hosted video platform like YouTube. It is about becoming more specialized and I think by doing so, it raises the possibility of creating a super-loyal user base. </p>

      It's important to make sure that TimeSink also creates a strong focus on the present. We don't want TimeSink to become a lifeless monument to history, but a healthy support network and a beacon of creative light for current and future generations of filmmakers.<br> <br>

      To catalyze the process of creation and discovery, TimeSink must be able to attract both viewers and filmmakers into the same network (aka, 'the sink'). To make these connections possible, we must design a service that provides value to each, and I believe that the strongest shared value is growth. <br> <br>

    To the filmmaker value is growth in audience, ideas, collaborators, recognition, and investors. We want filmmakers to be honored and excited about the possibility of having their films be presented on the platform. We want them to trust in the idea that a selection to TimeSink most likely means valuable support and exposure. To the viewer, value is growing a sense of belonging to a healthy community and a sense of participation in the creative act. It is growth in discovering new films, connecting with other minds, having great discussions, and perhaps making new friends.<br> <br>

     In order to create a robust community, it is necessary to create one that is accessible at all times. It can’t be limited like a festival typically is to only a couple of days per year. So what features can help achieve all of the above?

    <p>Deciding to build TimeSink as a mobile app was an obvious choice for me as it optimizes accessibility. <br> <br>

    Before continuing further into the features, it's important to identify the 10 basic models: </p>
