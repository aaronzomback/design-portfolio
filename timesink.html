    <p>If I were to claim that my design process is sparkling clean I'd be full of dust. In fact it's a clashing of ideas: reverse movement, forward movement, a circling back. I guess they call it iteration. Anyways, TimeSink is an on-going personal project of mine. You know, one of those projects where each day is a grind to continue. In these moments we have no choice but to keep moving ahead because it's our passion and creating is a joy. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app. Thanks for reading and I hope that I don't bore you. (but I probably will)</p>

    <p>As a filmmaker I consider the film industry to be like the wild west. There is no direct pathway towards growing an audience, securing distribution, or attracting investments. This is especially true for those who have little to no connections. <br> <br>

  We can try for our own distribution and upload films to YouTube or Vimeo but I've considered those platforms to be a far from ideal home for filmmakers. They are oversaturated and too generalized. It is likely that films will simply get lost among the noise of endless content. Film festivals can be helpful, but there still seems to be something lacking. Couldn't there be something else that offers a more sustained culture which could be like the vanguard of contemporary film? <br> <br>

  My heart has led me to believe that there needs to be a centralized catalyst in the film industry that not only helps emerging filmmakers break through the noise and get the support they need to continue their art form, but also a curated ‘go-to’ film community where people can expect to discuss, meet, and discover. Recognizing that it's not enough to impulsively draw from one's personal feelings and limited experiences, I needed to conduct research to determine whether such a platform could be helpful. </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:center">Research</h1>
    <p>Before thinking about a design for a new film platform, I first wanted to conduct research in order to validate problems shared by many filmmakers. <br> <br>

Instead of interviewing other filmmakers, I chose to investigate online forums - like reddit and nofilmschool.com - for discussion between anonymous filmmakers. I thought that this type of a sales safari method would be more efficient in diagnosing current filmmakers’ pain points as opposed to conducting personal interviews. <br> <br>

I began to notice a consensus emerging - filmmakers’ were disappointed that film festivals provided little value and support towards developing their careers. I discovered that most filmmakers submit to and attend film festivals in order to find collaborators, gain representation, secure distribution, or attract investments.

    <h1 style="text-align:center">The Problem</h1>
    <p>
      There doesn’t seem to be a trusted and viable place for emerging independent film talent to establish their work. Aside from a handful of larger film festivals, many filmmakers no longer trust nor consider them to be relevant, especially with personal representation and distribution options available (i.e. YouTube and Vimeo). This distrust appears to be caused by a lack of engagement and a lack of value generated towards their careers. Additionally, festivals often charge submission fees without providing proof of viewership. These impersonal experiences cause filmmakers to feel marginalized, disillusioned, and discouraged.

      As a catalyst, TimeSink must be able to bring viewers, creators, critics, and investors all into the same space. The solution is to create a service that provides value to all. Drawing from my research, the most significant value shared by each can be distilled into one grand idea; growth. There must be no dead-ends. <br> <br>

    To the filmmaker value is growth in audience, ideas, collaborators, recognition, and investments. To the viewer, value is growth in discovering new films. It is connecting with other minds, having great discussions, and perhaps making new friends.<br> <br>

    The vision is for TimeSink to become a PAINKILLER - by solving the contemporary problems that filmmakers are confronted with, and a VITAMIN - by creating an amusing experience where users are engaged and want to keep returning back to. Furthermore, in order to create a robust community, it is necessary to create one that is accessible at all times - i.e. it can’t be like a festival that is only held a couple of days per year. So what features can help achieve all of the above?

    <h1 style="text-align:center">Building a mobile app</h1>
    <p>Deciding to build TimeSink as a mobile app was an obvious choice for me as it optimizes accessibility. <br> <br>

    There are 8 basic models: </p>
  </div>

  <div class="model-list">
    <ol>
      <li><u>User</u> - user account system, login, sessions.</li>
      <li><u>Film</u> - films presented in a gallery-style showcase. </li>
      <li><u>Film review</u> - presented on each film’s show page, any user can write a film review.</li>
      <li><u>Film submission</u> - users will be able to submit films to be considered for presentation on TimeSink. </li>
      <li><u>Blog</u> - presenting articles written about cinema and opinion pieces about current events/politics. Stimulate debate and discussion. Comments section below each article. </li>
      <li><u>Forum</u> - an open space where users can make posts about anything. Featuring comments below each post. This provides another opportunity  for users to mingle and connect. </li>
      <li><u>Comment</u> - Users can comment beneath each film review, blog post, and forum post, and they can also comment on other comments (recursive). </li>
      <li><u>Reputation</u> - Users can earn reputation by receiving upvotes so they can grow to distinguish themselves within the community and earn other rewards.</li>
    </ol>

  <div class="user-onboarding-text">
  <h1 style="text-align:center">User onboarding, it's personal.</h1>
  <p>
    TimeSink immediately welcomes the new user by personalizing the sign-up process. The user will decide their own title by identifying themselves as either a cinephile, a filmmaker, a critic, or an investor.
