<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

      For creators, the film industry can seem daunting. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, independent filmmakers are encouraged to become self-reliant on distribution. <br> <br>

      I got the idea of creating a new platform called TimeSink that would help filmmakers connect with audiences by improving the experience of film festivals and art-house cinemas into an online network. <br> <br>

      As we see in art museums, art-house cinemas, and other galleries, the space that the work is experienced strongly influences how it is perceived. TimeSink will help focus audience expectations away from the quick bites of entertainment that we see on massive sites like YouTube, and shine a valuable spotlight on the films and its creators.

<section class="research">
<div class="research-text">
<ul>
<li>Most film festivals aren't able to provide the value that filmmakers expect: large audiences, distribution deals, & industry connections.</li>
<li>Many filmmakers are becoming disillusioned with the lack of transparency from festivals.</li>
<li>i.e. Festivals often charge submission fees without providing proof of viewing the film</li>
<li>Some filmmakes think that there is simply too much content these days, which makes it difficult to stand out.</li>
<li>At the best festivals, filmmakers often have to compete with other "indie"
   films that have budgets over >$100,000, which makes it difficult to compete.</li>

    <p>When the film was first released, it wasn’t a huge hit. It found its audience on the midnight movie circuit. Do you think a movie like Eraserhead could find an audience today?</p>
    <p class="lynch">No. The midnight movie circuit was what saved or brought a lot of films to the public...Ben Barenholtz, they call him “the grandfather of the midnight film” — if it wasn’t for Ben, I don’t think Eraserhead would have been discovered at all.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align:left">CONTEXT IS KEY</h1>
    <p>
     As we see in art museums, art-house cinemas, and other galleries, the environment and context that art is experienced in plays a significant role in how the artwork is perceived. Creating a dedicated space for films to redirect filmmakers away from massive sites like YouTube, and will help focus audience expectations and shine a valuable spotlight on both the films and its creators.<br> <br> Instead of more opportunities for self-monetization or self-distribution, filmmakers need more support and a healthy atmosphere where their work can flourish. This way they don't have to be casted on the same level as cheap entertainment.  <br> <br>This is where I think TimeSink can become successful. By leveraging the flaws in the current film festival model, this type of a film platform is not in competition with TikTok, Netflix, or YouTube, but instead its mission will be to develop honesty, transparency, and respect in a niche marketplace to support the present and future generations of filmmakers.</p>
