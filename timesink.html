<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="prologue-paragraph">
        <p> For creators, the film industry is a lot like the wild west. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, filmmakers often become rugged individualists and weary self-promoters. <br> <br>

            One of the great directors, Stanley Kubrick mentioned once in an interview that when he was a young man in New York City, the cinemas would play independent films after the feature presentations. This was a profound opportunity for an emerging talent like himself and the exposure helped develop his career. <br> <br>

            Such exciting and life-changing opportunities are non-existent in the 21st century where cinema screens are monopolized by mega-studio superhero flicks and rehashed sequels. Profit as the bottom line for cinemas and studios is nothing new, but it is clear now more than ever that filmmakers who want to tell different stories and push the art-form must look else where to show their work.

    <h5 style="text-align:left">RESEARCH</h5>

<p>Instead of interviewing other filmmakers, I chose to investigate online forums such as reddit, nofilmschool, and indiewire, for discussions between anonymous filmmakers and film enthusiasts. I thought that this type of a sales safari method would be more efficient in diagnosing current filmmakers’ pain points as opposed to conducting personal interviews.</p>

<p class="consensus-emerge"><b>I began to notice a consensus emerging - filmmakers’ were disappointed that film festivals provided little value and support towards developing their careers.</b></p>
<p>There's simply too much content for people to wrap their heads around these days. It's overwhelming for both viewers and creators alike. </p>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">The Problem</h5>
    <p>
      There is not a trusted and viable place for emerging independent film talent to establish their work. <br> <br>
       Aside from a handful of larger film festivals, many filmmakers no longer trust nor consider them to be relevant, especially with personal representation and distribution options available such as YouTube and Vimeo. <br> <br>The distrust appears to be caused by a lack of engagement and a lack of value generated towards their careers. Additionally, festivals often charge submission fees without providing proof of viewership. </p>
      <p class="impersonal"><b>These impersonal experiences cause filmmakers to feel marginalized, disillusioned, and discouraged.</b></p>

<section class="design-for">
  <div class="design-for-text">
    <h5 style="text-align:left">Who are we designing for?</h5>
    <p>If we want to differentiate TimeSink from platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo, then it’s not enough to design for filmmakers and viewers. Instead, the design must be crafted towards a specific persona and idea. </p>
       <p>At this stage I identified TimeSink’s niche user; namely those who appreciate the art and history of cinema. By doing this, we not only begin to articulate the types of films that TimeSink would curate (those who appreciate history often have developed taste) but also the brand personality, design principles, and overall theme. Already, this is different than a massive online hosted video platform like YouTube. It is about becoming more specialized and I think by doing so, it raises the possibility of creating a super-loyal user base. </p>

      To catalyze the process of creation and discovery, TimeSink must be able to attract both viewers and filmmakers into the same network (aka, 'the sink'). To make these connections possible, we must design a service that provides value to each, and I believe that the strongest shared value is growth. <br> <br>

    To the filmmaker value is growth in audience, ideas, collaborators, recognition, and investors. To the viewer, value is growing a connection to a healthy community and a sense of participation in the creative act. It is growth in discovering new films, connecting with other minds, having great discussions, and perhaps making new friends.<br> <br>

     In order to create a robust community, it is necessary to create one that is accessible at all times. It can’t be limited like a festival typically is to only a couple of days per year. So what features can help achieve all of the above?

    <p>Deciding to build TimeSink as a mobile app was an obvious choice for me as it optimizes accessibility. <br> <br>

    Before continuing further into the features, it's important to identify the basic models shown in the site map below: </p>
