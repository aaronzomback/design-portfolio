<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">WELCOME TO THE WILD WILD WEST</h5>
      </div>

      <div class="prologue-paragraph">
        <p> For creators, the film industry is a lot like the wild west. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, filmmakers are encouraged to become awkward individualists and weary self-promoters. <br> <br>

            One of the great directors of cinema, Stanley Kubrick, mentioned once in an interview that when he was a young man in New York City, the large cinemas would play local independent films after the feature presentations. <br> <br> <b>This made me think about how profound of an opportunity it must have been and how this exposure could have encouraged an entire generation of filmmakers.</b><br> <br>

            It seems such exciting and life-changing opportunities are rare in the 21st century where cinema screens are monopolized by mega-studio superhero flicks and rehashed sequels.  Have these opportunities been cast aside for a profitable formula? Or do these types of opportunities now exist on other platforms? To explore this, I first had to consider how much the media and social landscapes have changed since the 1950's (which is like prehistoric time in technology).

  <h5 style="text-align:center">MOVIES IN THE 2020'S</h5>
  <div class="current-platforms-paragraph">
      <p> "Broadcast yourself" was YouTube's first company slogan. Now, over a decade later YouTube has become the largest video platform in history. People have more access than ever before to present themselves and their work, all that's required is a simple video upload. But how has this impacted filmmakers?<br> <br>

                Well, in short (pun intended), short form video content has become king. With the rise of TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube shorts, the emphasis is now placed on the user-creators who are able to generate hundreds of thousands of views and therefore advertising revenue for their host companies. The problem with this type of system is that it tends to reward only a certain type of personality and creative style. How many filmmakers are being lost because they are not able to go viral?<br> <br>

        "We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO," said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings. For companies like Netflix, winning people's time and attention is now more important than anything, including winning content. As traditional film distribution companies began to shift their focus towards competing with popular social apps, can filmmakers compete with their short form content? <b> I don't think they have to nor should they try. </b><br> <br>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">INVESTIGATING THE <br>PROBLEMS</h5>
  <div class="research-text">


<p>To better understand the problems that filmmakers face, I chose to investigate online forums such as reddit, nofilmschool, and indiewire, for discussions between anonymous filmmakers and film enthusiasts. I thought that this type of a 'fly-on-the-wall' method would be more efficient in diagnosing current filmmakers’ pain points as opposed to conducting personal interviews and surveys.</p>

<p class="consensus-emerge"><b>I began to notice a consensus emerging - filmmakers often submit their films to festivals but they are frequently disappointed by the lack of value and support that film festivals generate towards developing their careers.</b> <br> <br>

With media becoming more specialized and film festivals representing a huge market for filmmakers, is it possible to improve the idea of film festivals and transform it into a year-round experience through an online platform?

    <h5 style="text-align:left">A NEW RENAISSANCE</h5>
    <p>
      Filmmakers are becoming disillusioned by the lack of transparency from film festivals. As new apps that promote self-distribution have emerged, many filmmakers are beginning to connect with audiences differently by uploading to sites like YouTube and Vimeo free of charge. <br> <br>
       Filmmakers simply want audiences to discover their work, but some don't realize how difficult it is to compete for attention on sites like YouTube or Vimeo without adequate self-promotion and strategy. The truth is that many types of content - especially films by emerging film talent - tend to get lost on massive sharing sites like YouTube.</p>
      <p class="impersonal"> Yet, in our culture the demand for artful films is still there (i.e. the success of of art-house production company, A24), it's just that we need more platforms who are sensitive to meet this demand. A new film platform doesn't have to concern itself with the fleeting 'quick bites' of entertainment, so long as they are dedicated to their niche.<br> <br>  <b> This is where I think TimeSink can become successful. By leveraging the flaws in the current film festival model, this type of a film platform is not in competition with TikTok, Netflix, or YouTube, but instead its mission will be to develop a niche marketplace to support the present and future generations of filmmakers.</b></p>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">FINDING OUR NICHE</h5>
    <p>I believe that competing with current film festivals will be possible if the platform gains the filmmakers' trust. But, if we want to differentiate TimeSink from apps such as YouTube, Netflix, or Vimeo, then it’s not enough to design for filmmakers and viewers. Instead, the design must be crafted towards a specific persona and idea. </p>
       <p>At this stage I identified TimeSink’s niche user; namely those who appreciate the art and history of cinema. By doing this, we not only begin to articulate the types of films that TimeSink would curate, as those who appreciate history often have developed taste, but also the brand personality, design principles, and overall theme. <br> <br>
         Already, this is different than a massive online hosted video platform like YouTube. <b> It is about becoming more specialized and I think by doing so, it raises the possibility of creating a super-loyal user base. </b> </p>

    <p>

      To catalyze the process of creation and discovery, TimeSink must be able to attract both viewers and filmmakers into the same network (the TimeSink!). To make these connections possible, we must design a service that provides value to each, and I believe that the strongest shared value is growth. <br> <br>

    To the filmmaker value is growth in audience, ideas, collaborators, recognition, and investors. To the viewer, value is growing a connection to a healthy community and a sense of participation in the creative act. It is growth in discovering new films, connecting with other minds, having great discussions, and perhaps making new friends.<br> <br>

     In order to create a robust community, it is necessary to create one that is accessible at all times. It can’t be limited like a festival typically is to only a couple of days per year. So what features can help achieve all of the above?

    Before continuing further into the features, it's important to identify the basic models shown in the site map below: </p>
