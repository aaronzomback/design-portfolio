<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

        <p> For creators, the film industry can seem daunting. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, independent filmmakers are encouraged to become self-reliant on distribution which often results in creating rugged individualism and tireless self-promotion.<br> <br>
        As media becomes easier to produce and consume, it paradoxically becomes more difficult for independent filmmakers to connect with audiences because it's easy to get lost among the 'noise' as there's just so much content out there. <br> <br> I got the idea of creating a new platform called TimeSink that would help filmmakers connect with audiences by improving the experience of film festivals and art-house cinemas into an online network.<br> <br>

<div class="research-text">
<ul>
<li>Film festivals still represent a large market for filmmakers</li>
<li>There are only a handful of festivals that are able to provide the value that filmmakers expect: large audiences, distribution deals, industry connections</li>
<li>Many filmmakers are becoming disillusioned with the lack of transparency from festivals.</li>
<li>Filmmakers want festivals to help grow their audience and introduce them to potential benefactors</li>

    <p>When the film was first released, it wasn’t a huge hit. It found its audience on the midnight movie circuit. Do you think a movie like Eraserhead could find an audience today?</p>
    <p class="lynch">No. The midnight movie circuit was what saved or brought a lot of films to the public...Ben Barenholtz, they call him “the grandfather of the midnight film” — if it wasn’t for Ben, I don’t think Eraserhead would have been discovered at all.</p>

  <div class="problem-text">
    <h1 style="text-align:left">CONTEXT IS KEY</h1>
    <p>
     As we see in art museums, art-house cinemas, and other galleries, the environment and context that art is experienced in plays a significant role in how the artwork is perceived. Creating a dedicated space for films to redirect filmmakers away from massive sites like YouTube, and will help focus audience expectations and shine a valuable spotlight on both the films and its creators.<br> <br> Instead of more opportunities for self-monetization or self-distribution, filmmakers need more support and a healthy atmosphere where their work can flourish. This way they don't have to be casted on the same level as cheap entertainment.  <br> <br>This is where I think TimeSink can become successful. By leveraging the flaws in the current film festival model, this type of a film platform is not in competition with TikTok, Netflix, or YouTube, but instead its mission will be to develop honesty, transparency, and respect in a niche marketplace to support the present and future generations of filmmakers.</p>
