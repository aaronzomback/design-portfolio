    <p>As a filmmaker I’ve always considered the film industry to be like the wild west. There is no direct pathway towards growing an audience, securing distribution, or attracting investments. This is especially true for those who have little to no connections. <br> <br>

  We can try for our own distribution and upload films to YouTube or Vimeo but I've always felt those platforms to be oversaturated and too generalized. It is likely that films will simply get lost among the noise of endless content. Film festivals can be helpful, but I've always wondered if there could be something else that offers a more sustained year-round approach that attracts activity. <br> <br>

  My heart has led me to believe that there needs to be a centralized catalyst in the film industry that not only helps emerging filmmakers break through the noise and get the support they need to continue their art form, but also a curated ‘go-to’ film community where people can expect to discuss, meet, and discover. How would such a platform be designed?</p>
