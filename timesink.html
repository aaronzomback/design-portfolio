    <p>If I were to claim that my design process was sparkling clean I'd be full of it. In fact it's a clashing of ideas: reverse movement, forward movement, a circling back. I guess they call it iteration. Anyways, TimeSink is an on-going personal project of mine. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">Prologue</h5>
    <p>As a filmmaker I consider the film industry to be like the wild west. There is no direct pathway towards growing an audience, securing distribution, or attracting investments. This is especially true for those who have little to no connections. <br> <br>

  We can try for our own distribution and upload films to YouTube or Vimeo but I've considered those platforms to be a far from ideal home for filmmakers; being oversaturated, too generalized, and requiring tireless self-promotion. Most films hosted on such platforms will simply get lost among the noise of endless content. There are film festivals which can be helpful, but there are thousands of them and many don't have the necessary gusto to support artists and launch careers. <br><br>

  <b>With blockbuster superhero films and repackaged sequels monopolizing cinema screens, it is clear that artists who want to tell different kinds of stories must find a new home.</b> <br> <br>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">Research</h5>

Instead of interviewing other filmmakers, I chose to investigate online forums such as reddit, nofilmschool, and indiewire, for discussion between anonymous filmmakers and film enthusiasts. I thought that this type of a sales safari method would be more efficient in diagnosing current filmmakers’ pain points as opposed to conducting personal interviews.</p>

<p class="consensus-emerge"><b>I began to notice a consensus emerging - filmmakers’ were disappointed that film festivals provided little value and support towards developing their careers.</b></p>
<p>There's simply too much content for people to wrap their heads around these days. It's overwhelming for both viewers and creators alike. </p>

<section class="problem">
  <div class="problem-text">
    <h5 style="text-align:left">The Problem</h5>
    <p>
      There is not a trusted and viable place for emerging independent film talent to establish their work. <br> <br>
       Aside from a handful of larger film festivals, many filmmakers no longer trust nor consider them to be relevant, especially with personal representation and distribution options available such as YouTube and Vimeo. <br> <br>The distrust appears to be caused by a lack of engagement and a lack of value generated towards their careers. Additionally, festivals often charge submission fees without providing proof of viewership. </p>
      <p class="impersonal"><b>These impersonal experiences cause filmmakers to feel marginalized, disillusioned, and discouraged.</b></p>

<section class="design-for">
  <div class="design-for-text">
    <h5 style="text-align:left">Who are we designing for?</h5>
    It’s not enough to design for filmmakers and viewers - if we want to differentiate TimeSink from platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo, the design must be crafted towards a specific persona and idea. </p>
       <p>At this stage I identified TimeSink’s niche user; namely those who appreciate the art and history of cinema. By doing this, we not only begin to articulate the types of films that TimeSink would curate (those who appreciate history often have developed taste) but also the brand personality, design principles, and overall theme. Already, this is different than a massive online hosted video platform like YouTube. It is about becoming more specialized and I think by doing so, it raises the possibility of creating a super-loyal user base. </p>

      To catalyze the process of creation and discovery, TimeSink must be able to attract both viewers and filmmakers into the same network (aka, 'the sink'). To make these connections possible, we must design a service that provides value to each, and I believe that the strongest shared value is growth. <br> <br>

    To the filmmaker value is growth in audience, ideas, collaborators, recognition, and investors. To the viewer, value is growing a connection to a healthy community and a sense of participation in the creative act. It is growth in discovering new films, connecting with other minds, having great discussions, and perhaps making new friends.<br> <br>

     In order to create a robust community, it is necessary to create one that is accessible at all times. It can’t be limited like a festival typically is to only a couple of days per year. So what features can help achieve all of the above?

    <p>Deciding to build TimeSink as a mobile app was an obvious choice for me as it optimizes accessibility. <br> <br>

    Before continuing further into the features, it's important to identify the basic models shown in the site map below: </p>

    TimeSink immediately welcomes the new user by personalizing the sign-up process. The user will decide their own title by identifying themselves as either a cinephile, a filmmaker, a critic, or an investor.
