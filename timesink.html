<p>TimeSink is an on-going personal project. I came up with the name one day when I was daydreaming and connected the image of a dripping faucet with the collection of time that we experience in films. Currently, I am writing code for an MVP web app using Ruby on Rails. In this case study, I present how I would create the mobile app.</p>

        For many filmmakers promoting their film and trying to find audiences can be difficult and overwhelming.
      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="prologue-paragraph">
        <p> For creators, the film industry can seem daunting. With no direct pathway towards finding an audience, independent filmmakers are encouraged to become self-reliant on distribution which often results in creating rugged individualism and tireless self-promotion.<br> <br>
        As media becomes easier to produce and consume, it paradoxically becomes more difficult for audiences to find and appreciate independent film because there's just so much content out there. I got the idea of creating a new platform called TimeSink that would help filmmakers connect with audiences by transforming the experience of art-house cinemas into an online network.<br> <br>

      <h3 style="text-align:left">Improving the UX of film festivals and art-house theaters</h3>

  <div class="research-text">


<p>To better understand the problems that filmmakers face, I chose to search online forums such as reddit, nofilmschool, and indiewire, for discussions between anonymous filmmakers and film enthusiasts. I thought that this method would be more efficient in diagnosing current filmmakers’ pain points as opposed to conducting personal interviews and surveys. <br> <br>
  I learned that many filmmakers are disillusioned by the film festival process and now favor self-distribution methods. The consensus is that there are only a select number of festivals that consistently offer filmmakers the value that they expect, which is exposure to audiences, industry executives, and distribution deals. On top of that, many festivals lack transparency as they don't provide any proof of viewing submitted films. <br> <br>
  Learning all of this, I began to imagine if there was a way to combine the elements that originally made film festivals popular along with the online experience that many filmmakers now seem to favor, to create an entirely new platform for independent filmmakers.

  <div class="problem-text">
    <h5 style="text-align:left">CONTEXT IS KEY</h5>
    <p>
     As we see in art museums, art-house cinemas, and other galleries, the environment and context that art is experienced in plays a significant role in how the artwork is perceived. Creating a dedicated space for films to redirect filmmakers away from a highly saturated site like YouTube, will help focus audience expectations and shine a valuable spotlight on both the films and its creators.<br> <br> Instead of more opportunities for self-monetization or self-distribution, filmmakers need more support and a healthy atmosphere where their work can flourish. This way they don't have to be casted on the same level as cheap entertainment.  <br> <br>This is where I think TimeSink can become successful. By leveraging the flaws in the current film festival model, this type of a film platform is not in competition with TikTok, Netflix, or YouTube, but instead its mission will be to develop honesty, transparency, and respect in a niche marketplace to support the present and future generations of filmmakers.</p>

    <h5 style="text-align:left">FINDING OUR NICHE</h5>
    <p>I believe that competing with current film festivals will be possible if the platform gains the filmmakers' trust. But, if we want to differentiate TimeSink from apps such as YouTube, Netflix, or Vimeo, then it’s not enough to design for filmmakers and viewers. Instead, the design must be crafted towards a specific persona and idea. </p>
       <p>At this stage I identified TimeSink’s niche user; namely those who appreciate the art and history of cinema. By doing this, we not only begin to articulate the types of films that TimeSink would curate, as those who appreciate history often have developed taste, but also the brand personality, design principles, and overall theme. <br> <br>
         Already, this is different than a massive online hosted video platform like YouTube. <b> It is about becoming more specialized and I think by doing so, it raises the possibility of creating a super-loyal user base. </b> </p>

    <p>

      To catalyze the process of creation and discovery, TimeSink must be able to attract both viewers and filmmakers into the same network (the TimeSink!). <b> With TimeSink, the platform is simultaneously the distribution and the audience. To make these connections possible, we must design a service that provides value - and I believe that the strongest shared value is growth. </b><br> <br>

      To the filmmaker value is growth in audience, ideas, collaborators, recognition, and investors. To the viewer, value is growing a connection to a healthy community and a sense of participation in the creative act. It is growth in discovering new films, connecting with other minds, having great discussions, and making new friends.<br> <br>

     In order to create a robust community, it is necessary to create one that is accessible at all times. It can’t be limited like a festival typically is to only a couple of days per year. So what features can help achieve all of the above?
